  <h3 class="paragraph header">What makes a patio so incredible?</h3>

  <p>I know tht writing a blog about patios might seem a bit strange, but in my view there are few things 
    in life more stunning than a well constructed patio. I've personally spend three summers building pations
    and it was the most enjoyable job i've ever worked. Something about creating an amazing strucure of stone and rock
    has always made me feel a deep sense of acomplishment. Watching a empty, wasted space turn into a nice area for relaxation 
    and enjoyment is never a waste of time. A patio is the arena where family outings take place,
    where neighbors and sit down together and relax, and where a family can spend a sunny weekend day enjoying a meal. 
    A nice patio also signifies the hard work, and intensive labor that was enacted to create such a beautiful collection of stone. 
    A well built pattio will have those who occupy it wondering why they would ever leave.

<p>When first looking at a nice pation your initial thinking should be, "how long did this take to make?". 
  By thinking about how many hours of hard labor it took to erect that patio, you will gain an understanding
  of how much respect your should give this patio. Another thing to consider is how many, if any, machines were used to construct this patio,
  if the patio was made by hand with no help from technology you should enjoy the intricacies and idosynchracies of the patio even more.
  If many machines were used to create this patio, then it's the speed of creation that you should be enamored by. You should 
  appreciate the prompt, and swift nature of a machine created patio. 
</p>
<p>The easiest way to enjoy your time spent out on the patio is to setup some outdoor furniture, and relax with good company.
  Of course, a grill is always a great option out on the patio: hotdogs, burgers, brats, salmon, steak, chicken. 
  All of these foods will bring great enjoyment to anyone lucky enough to be present them. An outdoor TV could lead to the patio being
  the perfect location to watch your favorites sports team. Being able to enjoy the outside air while watching 
  your team could bring a whole new level of enjoyment. An adjacent idea to this is having a TV located inside, but visible 
  from the patio. In this situation audio may become an issue, but the conversation with those on the patio with you 
  will prove more enjoyable.

Now that i've layed out a few ways to enjoy a patio, now it's time to talk about the construction.
Patios don't just apear out of nowhere, it takes a motivated indavidual or group to build such a thing. 
With the right direction and materials you could build a patio over the course of a few months and impress 
everyone who knows about it. However, hiring professionals will save you lots of time and work, and the 
end result will probably be a whole lot nicer. Either way, i'll go over my basic layout of how to build a 
beautiful patio.
