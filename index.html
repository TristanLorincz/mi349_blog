  <h3>The Construction of a Patio</h3>
  <p>Tristan Lorincz</p>
  <p>October 19, 2023 </p>
  <p>I know tht writing a blog about patios might seem a bit strange, but in my view there are few things 
    in life more stunning than a well constructed patio. A patio is the arena where family outings take place,
    where neighbors and sit down together and relax, and where a family can spend a sunny weekend day enjoying a meal. 
    A nice patio also signifies the hard work, and intensive labor that was enacted to create such a beautiful collection of stone. 
    A well built pattio will have those who occupy it wondering why they would ever leave.
